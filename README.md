# Project: Machine Learning Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the implementation and analysis of various machine learning models based on three Jupyter Notebooks:
1. **ML_Regression.ipynb** - Implementation and evaluation of regression models in machine learning.
2. **ML_Classification.ipynb** - Classification using various supervised learning algorithms.
3. **Titanic.ipynb** - Data analysis and application of classification methods to the Titanic dataset.

The goal of this project is to explore and apply machine learning methods in regression and classification problems while assessing their performance on real-world datasets. A structured approach was taken to prepare, process, and evaluate the data, ensuring best practices in feature engineering and model selection.

## Applied Methods
### Regression:
- **Linear Regression** - Understanding relationships between variables and making predictions.
- **Polynomial Regression** - Extending linear regression by introducing polynomial features.
- **Decision Trees** - Creating non-linear models using tree structures.
- **Ensemble Methods** - Random Forest and Gradient Boosting for improved predictive accuracy.

### Classification:
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** - Instance-based learning for pattern recognition.
- **Decision Trees** - Rule-based classification.
- **Random Forest** - An ensemble method improving decision trees.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** - Finding optimal hyperplanes for classification.
- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** - A neural network-based approach for complex pattern recognition.

### Feature Engineering:
- **Data Cleaning** - Handling missing values and inconsistent data.
- **Normalization and Standardization** - Scaling numerical features to enhance model performance.
- **Feature Selection** - Choosing relevant features to reduce complexity and improve efficiency.
- **Categorical Variable Encoding** - Transforming categorical data into numerical form.

## Data Analysis Approach
- **Titanic Dataset Exploration** - Examining missing values, handling inconsistencies, and transforming features for improved model performance.
- **Data Visualization** - Using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to gain insights into feature distributions and relationships.
- **Model Evaluation** - Utilizing metrics such as RMSE, RÂ², accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.

## Technologies Used
